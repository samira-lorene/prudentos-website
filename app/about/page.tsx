          Prudentos was founded in 2024 by Samira Lorene Prudentos in Berlin, in
          memory of her father and one of her closest friends. These influences
          sparked her desire to use her passion for fashion to create something
          meaningful and give back to society.
          <br />
          <br />
          Prudentos represents a harmonious blend of emotion and aesthetics. The
          brand combines love, friendship, and inspiration, translating these
          values into timeless fashion that reflects lightness, simplicity, and
          beauty. Samira sees fashion as a means of expressing individuality and
          a way to turn memories, dreams, and visions into reality.
